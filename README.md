This project is live at [My Bookmarks](https://thinkful-ei-shark.github.io/wassem-rylan-bookmarks-app/).

It is an excercise for the Thinkful coding bootcamp that had the following requirements.

# User Stories

## As a user:

I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. 

* Bookmarks contain:

    * title
    * url link
    * description
    * rating (1-5)

I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app.

All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating.

I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view.

The detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link.

I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list.

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark.

I can select a "minimum rating" from a dropdown to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection.

Optional extension feature: I can edit the rating and description of a bookmark in my list.

The application should check all validations in the API documentation (e.g., title and url field required).
